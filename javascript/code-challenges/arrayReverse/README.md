# Array Reverse

Pull Request [array-reverse](https://github.com/dcalhoun286/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/26)
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

Write a function called `reverseArray()` which takes an array as an argument.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Iterate the array with a for loop
- At each element, use `console.log()` to print the value

Big O:

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
