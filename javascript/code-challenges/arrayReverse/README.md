# Array Reverse

Pull Request [array-reverse](https://github.com/dcalhoun286/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/26)
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

Write a function called `reverseArray()` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Identify the start and end of the array (0 and length -1)
- Swap the arr[start] with arr[end]
- Move Start forward by 1
- Move End backwards by 1
- Repeat while start <= end
